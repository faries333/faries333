## Hi there 👋
🚀 About Me
I'm a BCA student and aspiring Data Scientist with a strong interest in data analytics and machine learning. I enjoy solving real-world business problems using data and building end-to-end ML solutions.

I have hands-on experience in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and building predictive models using Python and Scikit-learn. My projects focus on customer churn prediction, employee attrition analysis, and customer segmentation.

Currently, I am sharpening my skills in:

Data Analysis with Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
Machine Learning (Classification, Regression, Clustering)
Business-driven data problem solving
I am actively seeking internship opportunities in Data Analytics and Machine Learning.
